DB Project
Requires venv, Python3, Flask, flask-MySQLAlchemy.

To run this project, make sure to *set up a virtual environment, first.* I used python 3.5.2 64-bit throughout, on the Ubuntu x64 16.04 LTS operating system. To run the app:

1. Ensure you are in the same directory as wherever you're storing app.py, databases.py, and the templates folder (preferably in some form of Terminal or command prompt).

2. Start your virtual environment (ensuring that the version of Python used here is Python3 [I had to manually set it for my system, so make sure your python version is correct!])

3. Install the following dependencies (whatever their equivalent is for your OS, the following were named as such for Debian based systems): 
flask, flask-login, flask-mysqlalchemy

4. run app.py (i.e *python/python3 app.py*)

5. Go to URL *localhost:5000* on your favorite browser, preferably on a private window (so your history won't be tainted by localhost:#### spam
